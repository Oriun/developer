# Product Requirement Document: Next.js Fullstack Web Application

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a fullstack web application using Next.js. The application will allow users to write, publish, and manage blog posts. The architecture of the application should follow best practices for a scalable and maintainable web application.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**: Users should be able to register, login, and logout. Only authenticated users should be able to write and publish blog posts.

2. **Blog Posts**: Users should be able to create, edit, publish, and delete their own blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, content, and a published date. Users should also be able to save drafts of their blog posts before publishing.

3. **User Profile**: Each user should have a profile page where they can view and manage their blog posts.

4. **Homepage**: The homepage should display a list of all published blog posts. Each blog post should show a preview with the title, an excerpt from the content, and the published date.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The application should load quickly and respond to user interactions without delay.

2. **Security**: User authentication should be implemented securely. Passwords should be hashed and not stored in plain text.

3. **Error Handling**: The application should handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages to the user.

4. **Scalability**: The application should be designed to handle a large number of users and blog posts.

5. **Code Organization**: The codebase should be organized and maintainable. It should follow best practices for a Next.js application, including the use of pages, components, and hooks.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Next.js**: The application will be built using Next.js, a React framework that provides features such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

2. **Database**: A database will be used to store user and blog post data. MongoDB is recommended due to its flexibility and compatibility with JavaScript.

3. **Authentication**: User authentication should be implemented using a secure method such as JWT or OAuth.

4. **Styling**: The application should be styled in a clean and user-friendly manner. CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components or CSS modules can be used.

5. **Environment Variables**: The application should use environment variables to manage sensitive information such as database credentials. An `.env.example` file should be included in the project to describe the required environment variables.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements for a Next.js fullstack web application. The application will allow users to write, publish, and manage blog posts. The requirements are designed to be clear and straightforward, making this project suitable for a junior developer or anyone learning about fullstack web development. The inclusion of an `.env.example` file will ensure that necessary environment variables are properly set up. The application should be built following best practices for a scalable and maintainable web application.
