# Product Requirement Document: Node.js REST API

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a RESTful API using Node.js. The API will manage four main resources: Users, Posts, Categories, and Medias. The API will support operations for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting resources. The architecture of the application should follow the principles of Clean Architecture and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The application should also support clustering to improve performance and reliability. To keep the file size small and maintainable, the codebase should be organized into multiple small files, with a maximum of three functions per file.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Users**: Users are the primary actors who will interact with the API. Each user will have the ability to create, update, and delete their own posts, categories, and media. User authentication will be required for these actions.

2. **Posts**: Posts are created by users and can belong to one or more categories. Each post can include multiple media. Users should be able to create drafts of posts that are not immediately published, and schedule the publishing of these posts for a later date.

3. **Categories**: Categories are created by users and can be associated with multiple posts. Users should be able to create, update, and delete categories as they wish.

4. **Medias**: Media files are uploaded by users and can be associated with posts. Media files will be stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The API should support uploading and deleting media files, as well as associating them with posts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The API should respond to requests quickly and efficiently, even under high load.

2. **Security**: User authentication should be implemented to ensure that users can only access and modify their own resources. Passwords should be hashed and not stored in plain text.

3. **Error Handling**: The API should provide clear, helpful error messages when something goes wrong.

4. **Scalability**: The API should be designed in a way that allows it to scale to support a large number of users and resources.

5. **Clean Architecture**: The application should follow the principles of Clean Architecture, which promotes the separation of concerns, making the system more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

6. **MVC Pattern**: The application should follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This will help in organizing the codebase and making it easier to maintain and scale.

7. **Clustering**: The application should support clustering to improve performance and reliability. This involves creating multiple instances of the application to handle incoming requests, which can help to balance the load and provide redundancy in case of failures.

8. **Code Organization**: The codebase should be organized into multiple small files to keep the file size small and maintainable. This encourages modularity and makes it easier to understand and manage the code. Each file should contain a maximum of three functions to promote readability and maintainability.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Node.js**: The API will be built using Node.js. Express.js, a popular Node.js framework, will be used to handle routing and middleware.

2. **Database**: A database will be used to store data about users, posts, categories, and media. MongoDB is recommended due to its flexibility and compatibility with Node.js.

3. **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for user authentication.

4. **Amazon S3**: Amazon S3 will be used to store media files. The AWS SDK for JavaScript will be used to interact with S3.

5. **REST Principles**: The API should adhere to REST principles. This includes using the appropriate HTTP methods for different operations (GET for retrieving resources, POST for creating resources, PUT or

PATCH for updating resources, DELETE for deleting resources) and providing meaningful HTTP status codes.

6. **Environment Variables**: The application should use environment variables to manage sensitive information such as database credentials, JWT secret key, and AWS credentials. An `.env.example` file should be included in the project to describe the required environment variables.

## Mandatory Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API. This is a crucial feature to maintain the integrity and performance of the API.

2. **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring to track API usage and performance, and to help identify and troubleshoot issues. This will help in maintaining the health of the API and ensure smooth operation.

3. **API Documentation**: Provide clear, comprehensive API documentation to help users understand how to use the API. This is essential for the usability of the API and to assist developers in effectively using it.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements for a Node.js REST API. The API will manage users, posts, categories, and media, with a focus on performance, security, and scalability. The application's architecture should adhere to the principles of Clean Architecture and the MVC pattern, ensuring a well-organized and maintainable codebase. The application should also support clustering to improve performance and reliability. The codebase should be organized into multiple small files to keep the file size small and maintainable, with a maximum of three functions per file. This promotes readability and maintainability. The requirements are designed to be clear and straightforward, making this project suitable for a junior developer or anyone learning about API development. The inclusion of an `.env.example` file will ensure that necessary environment variables are properly set up. Additionally, the mandatory enhancements of rate limiting, logging and monitoring, and comprehensive API documentation are crucial for maintaining a robust, user-friendly, and efficient API.
