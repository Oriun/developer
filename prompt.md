# Product Requirement Document: Golang Authentication Microservice

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an Authentication Microservice using Golang. The service will handle user registration, login, logout, permissions management for other microservices, and OAuth authentication with providers like Google and Facebook. The service should be both horizontally and vertically scalable, resistant to race conditions, and secure against cyber attacks. Detailed installation, build, and run steps should be documented in a dedicated file.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration**: Users should be able to register by providing necessary details. The service should validate the input, check for existing users, and securely store user data.

2. **User Login**: Users should be able to login using their credentials. The service should validate the credentials and provide a token for authenticated sessions.

3. **User Logout**: Users should be able to logout, invalidating their current session token.

4. **Permissions Management**: The service should handle permissions for different microservices. It should be able to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to access a particular service.

5. **OAuth Authentication**: The service should support OAuth authentication with providers like Google and Facebook. Users should be able to register and login using their Google or Facebook accounts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: The service should be both horizontally and vertically scalable to handle a large number of users and high load.

2. **Concurrency**: The service should be resistant to race conditions. It should handle concurrent requests correctly and safely.

3. **Security**: The service should be secure against cyber attacks. It should use secure methods for storing passwords, such as hashing, and should use secure communication protocols.

4. **Resilience**: The service should be designed to be resilient. It should handle errors gracefully and recover from failures quickly.

5. **Performance**: The service should respond to requests quickly and should not consume excessive resources.

## Technical Requirements

1. **Golang**: The service will be built using Golang, a statically typed, compiled language that is well-suited for concurrent programming and is efficient in resource usage.

2. **Database**: A database will be used to store user data and permissions. A database that supports ACID transactions, like PostgreSQL, is recommended to prevent data inconsistencies and race conditions.

3. **Authentication**: The service should use JWT for session management. OAuth2 should be used for handling authentication with providers like Google and Facebook.

4. **Environment Variables**: The service should use environment variables to manage sensitive information such as database credentials and OAuth client secrets. An `.env.example` file should be included in the project to describe the required environment variables.

5. **Installation, Build, and Run Documentation**: Detailed instructions for installing, building, and running the service should be provided in a dedicated documentation file. This should include steps for setting up the development environment, building the service, running tests, and starting the service.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the requirements for a Golang Authentication Microservice. The service will handle user registration, login, logout, permissions management, and OAuth authentication. The requirements are designed to be clear and straightforward, making this project suitable for developers with a basic understanding of Golang and authentication mechanisms. The service should be scalable, resistant to race conditions, and secure against cyber attacks. The inclusion of an `.env.example` file will ensure that necessary environment variables are properly set up. Detailed installation, build, and run steps should be documented in a dedicated file to guide developers through the setup and execution process.
